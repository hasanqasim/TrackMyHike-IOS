#  IoT embedded application with real-time Temp, Altitude, Pressure and Light sensing for iOS and watchOS

                                                                   
### This smart IoT application is built primarily for Hiking/Trekking where users can make sense of altitude, light, pressure and temperature conditions in real time.

- Features a Raspberry Pi Server in Python to read in sensor data from multiple sensors.
-	Design and implement a scalable Google Firebase database to store sensor data in real time.
- Features an additional NoSQL database to store data offline.
-	Has an iOS client to analyze and visualize sensor readings overtime.
-	Also has a watchOS application to display sensor readings in real time.
-	Tools: Swift, iOS, watchOS, Raspberry Pi, Python, altimeter, RGB Color Sensor, Google Firebase
